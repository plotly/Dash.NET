    ///<summary>
    ///A slider component with a single handle.
    ///&#10;
    ///Properties:
    ///&#10;
    ///• id (string) - The ID of this component, used to identify dash components
    ///in callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the
    ///components in an app.
    ///&#10;
    ///• marks (dict with values of type: string | record with the fields: 'label: string (optional)', 'style: record (optional)') - Marks on the slider.
    ///The key determines the position (a number),
    ///and the value determines what will show.
    ///If you want to set the style of a specific mark point,
    ///the value should be an object which
    ///contains style and label properties.
    ///&#10;
    ///• value (number) - The value of the input
    ///&#10;
    ///• drag_value (number) - The value of the input during a drag
    ///&#10;
    ///• className (string) - Additional CSS class for the root DOM node
    ///&#10;
    ///• disabled (boolean) - If true, the handles can't be moved.
    ///&#10;
    ///• dots (boolean) - When the step value is greater than 1,
    ///you can set the dots to true if you want to
    ///render the slider with dots.
    ///&#10;
    ///• included (boolean) - If the value is true, it means a continuous
    ///value is included. Otherwise, it is an independent value.
    ///&#10;
    ///• min (number) - Minimum allowed value of the slider
    ///&#10;
    ///• max (number) - Maximum allowed value of the slider
    ///&#10;
    ///• tooltip (record with the fields: 'always_visible: boolean (optional)', 'placement: value equal to: 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom', 'topLeft', 'topRight', 'bottomLeft', 'bottomRight' (optional)') - Configuration for tooltips describing the current slider value
    ///&#10;
    ///• step (number) - Value by which increments or decrements are made
    ///&#10;
    ///• vertical (boolean) - If true, the slider will be vertical
    ///&#10;
    ///• verticalHeight (number; default 400) - The height, in px, of the slider if it is vertical.
    ///&#10;
    ///• updatemode (value equal to: 'mouseup', 'drag'; default mouseup) - Determines when the component should update its &#96;value&#96;
    ///property. If &#96;mouseup&#96; (the default) then the slider
    ///will only trigger its value when the user has finished
    ///dragging the slider. If &#96;drag&#96;, then the slider will
    ///update its value continuously as it is being dragged.
    ///If you want different actions during and after drag,
    ///leave &#96;updatemode&#96; as &#96;mouseup&#96; and use &#96;drag_value&#96;
    ///for the continuously updating value.
    ///&#10;
    ///• loading_state (record with the fields: 'is_loading: boolean (optional)', 'prop_name: string (optional)', 'component_name: string (optional)') - Object that holds the loading state object coming from dash-renderer
    ///&#10;
    ///• persistence (boolean | string | number) - Used to allow user interactions in this component to be persisted when
    ///the component - or the page - is refreshed. If &#96;persisted&#96; is truthy and
    ///hasn't changed from its previous value, a &#96;value&#96; that the user has
    ///changed while using the app will keep that change, as long as
    ///the new &#96;value&#96; also matches what was given originally.
    ///Used in conjunction with &#96;persistence_type&#96;.
    ///&#10;
    ///• persisted_props (list with values of type: value equal to: 'value'; default ['value']) - Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing the
    ///component or the page. Since only &#96;value&#96; is allowed this prop can
    ///normally be ignored.
    ///&#10;
    ///• persistence_type (value equal to: 'local', 'session', 'memory'; default local) - Where persisted user changes will be stored:
    ///memory: only kept in memory, reset on page refresh.
    ///local: window.localStorage, data is kept after the browser quit.
    ///session: window.sessionStorage, data is cleared once the browser quit.
